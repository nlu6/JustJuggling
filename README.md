# Summary
This game is a rhythm based juggling game that consist of pressing keys on your keyboard at the right times. The player will have the choice of speed for the ball by using a difficulty slider in the options menu as well as being able to change the volume of the music and the input delay of how late they are able to press the correct key. If the player pressed the correct key at the correct time, they will gain points. If they press the wrong key, they will lose points. There will also be bonus inputs being shown to the player that will add to their score, but not end the game if they miss it. The game will be over when the player misses a key.  
To ensure the game will be more difficult, there will be a crowd member walking in front of the camera when in the default position that could mess with the player's inputs. The camera will also be changing at random times throughout the song so they could possibly miss an input by a sudden camera change.
