 * 
 * Purpose: Script monitors the hands of the player and looks for
 *          both a player input and a juggling object input occurring
 *          at the same time. If both are present and input is correct
 *          it will update the physics of the juggling object to it's
 *          next throw trajectory. Script asks {MUSIC SYNC SCRIPT SOMEWHERE}
 *          how long to put the object in the air for.
 * 
 * Binds With: Juggling Hands Objects
 * Modifies: Juggling Object Physics,
 *           Player Score Value,
 *           etc.
